I saw your listing on Instagram for the AI Engineer role at Kausar, and am excited because this is exactly the job that I’ve been looking for to my skills on artificial intelligence and machine learning to solve complex engineering problems. With a strong academic background in Applied Data Science and hands-on experience in deploying AI solutions in web and backend applications, I am eager to contribute to your team’s innovative projects.

During my studies, I worked on many AI and ML projects, where I honed my skills in model development, optimization, and deployment. For example, I developed an AI chatbot that that significantly increased user engagement, leading to hundreds of visitors on the page.
